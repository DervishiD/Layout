StringDisplay text with numbers

Initialize Displayers in reverse?
    if l listens to b, l must be added *before* b, which will cause mistakes

Add default fonts and colors setters to LFrames / LFrameBuilders?

StringBuilders everywhere

Iterables

Clean mouse stuff, too many overridable things

Displayable interface
    And Displayer Grids
    What does a Displayable have?
        --updateRelativeValues()
        --is LTimerUpdatable
        --paintComponent() or such
        --onAdd(), onRemove()
        if component, added on container
        --requestUpdate method, and listeners
