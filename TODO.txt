Probability distributions project
    Homogeneous distribution
    Create a test system using a distribution of points on a Canvas
    Create a test to find an ok trust interval, maybe using buckets
    Other distributions
        Gaussian
        Exponential
        Polynomial
        Logarithmic
        Root
        Arcsin
        Double gaussian
        Inverse Gaussian, Lots in borders, few in center
        Sine curve
        integral of sine curve plus constant, cosx + x -like
        Poisson-like
